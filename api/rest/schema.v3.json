    "description": "# Introduction<br/> Weaviate is an open source, AI-native vector database that helps developers create intuitive and reliable AI-powered applications. <br/> ### Base Path <br/>The base path for the Weaviate server is structured as `[YOUR-WEAVIATE-HOST]:[PORT]/v1`. As an example, if you wish to access the `schema` endpoint on a local instance, you would navigate to `http://localhost:8080/v1/schema`. Ensure you replace `[YOUR-WEAVIATE-HOST]` and `[PORT]` with your actual server host and port number respectively. <br/> ### Questions? <br/>If you have any comments or questions, please feel free to reach out to us at the community forum [https://forum.weaviate.io/](https://forum.weaviate.io/). <br/>### Issues? <br/>If you find a bug or want to file a feature request, please open an issue on our GitHub repository for [Weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate). <br/>### Need more documentation? <br/>For a quickstart, code examples, concepts and more, please visit our [documentation page](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate).",

Resources can be specified broadly (e.g., all collections: `*`) or narrowly (e.g., a specific collection name, tenant pattern, user name, or role name).<br/><br/>**Roles:** Are named sets of permissions. Managing roles involves creating roles with specific permissions, retrieving role definitions, deleting roles, and adding or removing permissions from existing roles.<br/><br/>**Role assignment:** Roles grant their contained permissions to users or groups. These endpoints allow assigning roles to:<br/>* `db` users: Users managed directly by Weaviate via API or environment variables, authenticating with API keys.<br/>* `oidc` users: Users authenticated via an external OpenID Connect provider, managed externally but assigned roles within Weaviate.<br/>* OIDC `groups`: Users authenticated via OIDC who belong to a group automatically inherit roles assigned to that group.<br/><br/>Operations also include revoking roles, checking if a role has a specific permission, listing roles assigned to a user, and listing users/groups assigned to a role. The authorization framework applies universally to both `db` and `oidc` users based on their assigned roles."
