Added nodes may either be initialized empty (null) or created by replicating data from a source node specified as a string. If a source node is also marked for removal in the same shard, it represents a move operation and can only be used once as a source for that shard. If a source node is not marked for removal, it represents a copy operation and can be used as the source for multiple additions in that shard. Nodes listed in 'removeNodes' cannot also appear as targets in 'addNodes' for the same shard, and the same node cannot be specified for both addition and removal in a single shard.

    - description: Operations for managing individual data objects. Objects are the primary units of data stored within Weaviate collections. Each object conforms to the data schema definition of its parent collection, containing specific properties (data fields). Objects have one or multiple associated vector embeddings and can link to other objects via cross-references. These endpoints allow you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on individual data objects.

    - description: Operations for performing actions on multiple data items (objects or references) in a single API request. Batch operations significantly improve performance and efficiency, especially for bulk data imports or large-scale deletions, by reducing network overhead compared to sending individual requests. These endpoints allow for creating multiple objects or deleting objects based on filters.

    - description: 'Operations related to managing collections. In Weaviate, ''collections'' (formerly called ''classes'') store your data objects. Each collection has a definition that specifies its data structure (properties and their data types), vectorizer settings (how vectors are generated or managed), and indexing configuration (how data is indexed for efficient search). These endpoints allow you to create, retrieve, update, and delete collection definitions. For detailed usage and code examples on interacting with collections, see the documentation: [https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/manage-data/collections](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/manage-data/collections).'

    - description: Operations related to creating and managing backups of Weaviate data. This feature allows you to create snapshots of your collections and store them on external storage backends such as cloud object storage (S3, GCS, Azure) or a shared filesystem. These endpoints enable you to initiate backup and restore processes, monitor their status, list available backups on a backend, and delete unwanted backups. Backups are essential for disaster recovery, data migration, and maintaining point-in-time copies of your vector database.

    - description: Endpoints for user account management in Weaviate. This includes operations specific to Weaviate-managed database users (`db` users), such as creation (which generates an API key), listing, deletion, activation/deactivation, and API key rotation. It also provides operations applicable to any authenticated user (`db` or `oidc`), like retrieving their own information (username and assigned roles).<br/><br/>**User Types:**<br/>* **`db` users:** Managed entirely within Weaviate (creation, deletion, API keys). Use these endpoints for full lifecycle management.<br/>* **`oidc` users:** Authenticated via an external OpenID Connect provider. Their lifecycle (creation, credentials) is managed externally, but their role assignments *within Weaviate* are managed via the `authz` endpoints.

    - description: 'Endpoints for managing Weaviate''s Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. Access to Weaviate resources is granted through roles, which are collections of fine-grained permissions. <br/><br/>**Permissions:** Define allowed actions (e.g., `read_data`, `create_collections`, `delete_users`) on specific resources. Resources can be specified broadly (e.g., all collections: `*`) or narrowly (e.g., a specific collection name, tenant pattern, user name, or role name).<br/><br/>**Roles:** Are named sets of permissions. Managing roles involves creating roles with specific permissions, retrieving role definitions, deleting roles, and adding or removing permissions from existing roles.<br/><br/>**Role assignment:** Roles grant their contained permissions to users or groups. These endpoints allow assigning roles to:<br/>* `db` users: Users managed directly by Weaviate via API or environment variables, authenticating with API keys.<br/>* `oidc` users: Users authenticated via an external OpenID Connect provider, managed externally but assigned roles within Weaviate.<br/>* OIDC `groups`: Users authenticated via OIDC who belong to a group automatically inherit roles assigned to that group.<br/><br/>Operations also include revoking roles, checking if a role has a specific permission, listing roles assigned to a user, and listing users/groups assigned to a role. The authorization framework applies universally to both `db` and `oidc` users based on their assigned roles.'
