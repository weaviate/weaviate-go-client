Package ./api contains contracts for REST and gRPC APIs in the Weaviate server.

- oapi-codegen.yaml -- config file for ./bin/oapi-codegen.
- proto/ -- Protobufs definitions for gRPC stubs.
- rest/ -- OpenAPI schema for REST models.
    - `schema.check.json` -- Original OpenAPI v2 schema definition from the server.
    Source: https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/blob/main/openapi-specs/schema.json
    - `schema.v3.yaml` -- Generated v3 schema, as oapi-codegen does not support v2.
    Converted using Swagger Converter API. Uses YAML to enable comments.
    See: https://converter.swagger.io/api/convert

It is OK to delete proto/ and rest/ directories, as they can be re-created by ./cmd/build.go.
DO NOT DELETE `oapi-codegen.yaml`

Generated artifacts are committed to VCS, but will change as the contracts get updated.
To re-generate them locally, run:

    go generate ./...
